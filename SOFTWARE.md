# Software

Links to software/firmware used in my projects.

## List
* [HomeAssistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) - Used as my main automation platform and to display states from all my sensors etc. Integrates with ESPHome and WLED.
* [ESPHome](https://github.com/esphome/esphome) - Configuring and making firmware for ESP32/ESP8266 etc. Easily adding sensors, buttons, screens, camera modules or monitoring Bluetooth-devices. ESPHome has a lot to offer.
* [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED) - Firmware for ESP32/ESP8266 enabling them to control LEDs like WS2812B.

## Not yet tried, but planning to check out
* [xLights](https://xlights.org/) - Software to synchronise ESP32/ESP8266 LED-controllers to create elaborate scenes/shows, even time it to music.
